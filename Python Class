Write a Python function that counts the frequency of each word in a given paragraph. The function should return the result as a dictionary. Additionally, provide a way to retrieve the most frequently occurring word(s) from this dictionary
input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world ... by Zayn Hussain
Zayn Hussain
9:34 PM
input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere; surprises are fun"

{     'hello': 2,     'world': 3,    ... by Zayn Hussain
Zayn Hussain
9:34 PM
{
    'hello': 2,
    'world': 3,
    'this': 1,
    'is': 1,
    'full': 1,
    'of': 1,
    'surprises': 3,
    'are': 3,
    'everywhere': 1,
    'fun': 1
}
Most frequent word(s): ['world', 'surprises']

Solution:

import re
from collections import Counter

def count_word_frequency(paragraph):
    # Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation using regex
    cleaned_paragraph = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', paragraph.lower())
    
    # Split paragraph into words
    words = cleaned_paragraph.split()
    
    # Count word frequencies
    word_count = Counter(words)
    
    return word_count

def most_frequent_words(word_count):
    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(word_count.values())
    
    # Find all words with the maximum frequency
    most_frequent = [word for word, freq in word_count.items() if freq == max_freq]
    
    return most_frequent

# Test with the provided input
input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere; surprises are fun"
word_count = count_word_frequency(input_paragraph)
most_frequent = most_frequent_words(word_count)

# Print results
print("Word Count:", dict(word_count))
print("Most Frequent Word(s):", most_frequent)
